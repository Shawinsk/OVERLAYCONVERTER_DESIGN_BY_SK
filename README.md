[INTRODUCTION]

The Overlay Converter is a specialized local tool designed to extract assets and configuration data from StreamElements `.overlay` files (which are technically ZIP archives). It features a high-performance "Gaming" aesthetic interface with a focus on ease of use and efficiency.

[KEY FEATURES]

1. **Drag & Drop Interface**

   - Large, centralized upload zone.

   - Simply drag your `.overlay` or `.zip` file to start.

2. **Dual Operation Modes**

   - **Media Extraction:** Visual gallery to view and download images and videos (.png, .webm, .mp4, etc.).

   - **Data Dump (JSON):** instantly converts the overlay's file structure and code (JS, CSS, JSON) into a single readable `overlay_data.json` file.

3. **Advanced File Management**

   - **File Manifest (Sidebar):** Lists every file in the archive.

   - **Bulk Actions:** Select specific files using checkboxes and download them in batches.

   - Works for both the Media Gallery and the complete File List.

4. **Premium Gaming UI**

   - Neon styling (Purple/Cyan theme).

   - Responsive "Rajdhani" typography.

   - Smooth animations and glassmorphism effects.

[HOW TO USE]

1. Open `index.html` as described above.

2. Drag and drop your target `.overlay` file into the "Initiate Upload" box.

3. Choose your desired action:

   - Click **MEDIA EXTRACTION** to view images and videos.

   - Click **DATA DUMP** to get the configuration JSON immediately.

4. In Media Mode:

   - Use the Sidebar to see all files. Check the boxes to download specific items.

   - Use the Main Gallery to preview visuals.

   - Click "Download Selected" to save multiple files at once.

[REQUIREMENTS]
